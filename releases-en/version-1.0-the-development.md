### **✨ Major Feature 2**

We have now a API!

Before, each page was a single file. And our content writer (Decon M. Vorn) had to create an extra file for each article. This ends up in hundreds of files. Even at a very early stage. Furthermore, we had to change global changes and titles etc. in each file individually.

Now we have a own API with Database connection and global Components which makes everything much easier!
