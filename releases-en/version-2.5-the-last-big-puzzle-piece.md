# Version 2.5: The last big puzzle piece

### **üì¢ Introduction**

**Here are we with the update 2.5!**

The update 2.5 is another big step for the ArisCorp Website! It's the last big piece of the puzzle that was missing on the website.

### **‚ú® Major Feature 1**

The website has now the long awaited [ShipExkurs](https://ariscorp.de/ShipExkurs)!

**Features in the first iteration of the ShipExkurs**

In our ShipExcurs you can look up all information abvout hte ships of the Verse.\
What specifications they have, the lore behind the ship, loaners and variants of the ship.

#### ArisCorp rating

In addition, we have introduced the ArisCorp rating for each ship.\
An individually by us created rating of each ship that exists in the verse.\
A ship is evaluated in different objective points and compared with similar ships. \
Then there is one of our subjective opinions.

#### Future features

Other functions follow, such as paints, hardpoints, components, a comparison page, an overview page for which vehicles and ships fit into which ships, where you can buy which ships and other information and features.

In addition, we are in the process of developing our own API that works with the P4K data.\
That would mean 100% accuracy and timeliness of our data.

### **‚ú® Major Feature 2**
