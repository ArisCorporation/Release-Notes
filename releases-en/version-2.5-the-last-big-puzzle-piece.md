# Version 2.5: The last big puzzle piece

### **üì¢ Introduction**

**Here are we with the update 2.5!**

The update 2.5 is another big step for the ArisCorp Website! It's the last big piece of the puzzle that was missing on the website.

### **‚ú® Major Feature 1**

The website has now the long awaited [ShipExkurs](https://ariscorp.de/ShipExkurs)!

#### Features in the first iteration of the ShipExkurs

In our ShipExcurs you can look up all information about the ships of the Verse.\
What specifications they have, the lore behind the ship, loaners, paints and variants of the ship.

#### ArisCorp rating

In addition, we have introduced the ArisCorp rating for each ship.\
An individually by us created rating of each ship that exists in the verse.\
A ship is evaluated in different objective points and compared with similar ships. \
Then there is one of our subjective opinions.

#### Future features

Other functions follow, such as a comparison page, all ship q&a's on the ship page translated, an overview page for which vehicles and ships fit into which ships, where you can buy which ships, a booklet like reader for brochures, a 3d viewer for each ship model and more!

In addition, we are in the process of developing our very own P4K Unpacking Tool. \
That would mean 100% accuracy **and** timeliness of our data with up to only max 1h after live patch! \
This tool will also be public available!

### **‚ú® Major Feature 2**

An [Attachmentindex](https://ariscorp.de/VerseExkurs/attachments) is now added to the Weapon Index!

You can learn all about the Verse weapon attachments here.

### **‚ú® Major Feature 3**

The member [biography page](https://ariscorp.de/biografie/Thomas%20Blakeney) are completely reworked and in a new layout with special customization features (on request)

Additionally we have created an integration for the [ShipExkurs](https://ariscorp.de/ShipExkurs) and the [Weapons Index](https://ariscorp.de/VerseExkurs/waffen), so that all members can display their ships or favorite weapons!
